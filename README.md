# Learning the Rust Programming Language

## Code examples

* Parser

## Documentations

* Code Guidelines:
   * https://developers.diem.com/main/docs/coding-guidelines
   * Rust Style Guide https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md), 
   * API Guidelines https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/about.html

* Rust documentations: 
   * [X] https://foundation.rust-lang.org/
   * Learn about Rust in https://www.rust-lang.org/learn 
   * [X] The book https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html 
   * Learn by examples https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html 
   * [X] Rustlings code: https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/ .
      It is a requirement to install msvc C++ tools from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16
   * [X] Cheat Sheets: https://cheats.rs/, https://programming-idioms.org/cheatsheet/Rust
    
* Rust libraries and applications:
   * https://lib.rs/
 
* Rust installation:
    * [X] Rust programm: https://rustup.rs/
    * [X] IDE Eclipse: https://github.com/eclipse/corrosion or from the official eclipse installer.

* The Cargo book: Cargo is the Rust package manager. Cargo downloads your Rust package's dependencies, compiles your packages, makes distributable packages, and uploads them to crates.io, the Rust communityâ€™s package registry (this last part can be avoided).
   * https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html 

* Antlr for rust:
   * [X] https://crates.io/crates/antlr-rust 
 
   Steps to use:
    * [X] Download the last release from github's repository https://github.com/rrevenantt/antlr4rust
    * [X] Store the grammar file
    * [X] Generate the parser java -jar <path to ANTLR4 tool> -Dlanguage=Rust MyGrammar.g4

## Cheets

* Compile with no warnings:  alias test='RUSTFLAGS=-Awarnings cargo +nightly test -- --nocapture'

## Utils

* translate Java to Rust: https://github.com/aschoerk/converter-page

## Compare to C in embedded systems

| features | Rust      | C |
| -- | --------  | -------- |
safety |  compile-time  | hard |
learn | similar to C  |  |
sintax | similar to C  |  |
abstractions | more | fewer |
primitive standard library | more and can be turned off | fewer |
sintax | similar to C  |  |
bitwise operation over register values [1](https://opensource.com/article/20/1/c-vs-rust-abstractions) | easy and secure to implement | complex to implement |
coding standards for programming critical systems | data      | data |
easy to verify and catch bugs | data      | data |
tools to debug | data      | data |
tools to testing | data      | data |
tools to code verification | data      | data |
integration with [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) | good | good |

GCC | not yet implemented | a bit faster |
